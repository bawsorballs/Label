# Black And White Studios

Music is routinely categorized, pigeonholed and generally boxed in. It's no good for those creative souls who push the envelope a little and fear alienating their audience. They have to make a decision to be black or white.

Not anymore.

Black And White Studios started with the intention to showcase some of the best independent music that we find, regardless of genre or style.
